# mean-password-app
Foundation for a MEAN user-based web app. Features passport, bcrypt, mongoose, and sendgrid (for forgotten password reset, although it would be quite simple to replace send grid with another mail service).

# Getting Started
First install MongoDB. Open a terminal tab and issue the command mongod to start running a mongo instance locally.
Clone the git repo to your disk, cd into it, and issue 
Inline `code` npm install && npm start
This should get you up and running on localhost:3000!
Now build up
